# Telegraf Configuration
#
# Telegraf is entirely plugin driven. All metrics are gathered from the
# declared inputs, and sent to the declared outputs.
#
# Plugins must be declared in here to be active.
# To deactivate a plugin, comment out the name and any variables.
#
# Use 'telegraf -config telegraf.conf -test' to see what metrics a config
# file would generate.
#
# Environment variables can be used anywhere in this config file, simply prepend
# them with $. For strings the variable must be within quotes (ie, "$STR_VAR"),
# for numbers and booleans they should be plain (ie, $INT_VAR, $BOOL_VAR)


# Global tags can be specified here in key="value" format.
[global_tags]
  # dc = "us-east-1" # will tag all metrics with dc=us-east-1
  # rack = "1a"
  ## Environment variables can be used as tags, and throughout the config file
  # user = "$USER"
  {% for key, value in environment('TAG_') %}{{ key }}="{{ value }}"
  {% endfor %}


# Configuration for telegraf agent
[agent]
  ## Default data collection interval for all inputs
  interval = "{{ INTERVAL | default("10s") }}"
  ## Rounds collection interval to 'interval'
  ## ie, if interval="10s" then always collect on :00, :10, :20, etc.
  round_interval = {{ ROUND_INTERVAL | default("true") }}

  ## Telegraf will cache metric_buffer_limit metrics for each output, and will
  ## flush this buffer on a successful write.
  metric_buffer_limit = 1000
  ## Flush the buffer whenever full, regardless of flush_interval.
  flush_buffer_when_full = true

  ## Collection jitter is used to jitter the collection by a random amount.
  ## Each plugin will sleep for a random time within jitter before collecting.
  ## This can be used to avoid many plugins querying things like sysfs at the
  ## same time, which can have a measurable effect on the system.
  collection_jitter = "{{ COLLECTION_JITTER | default("1s") }}"

  ## Default flushing interval for all outputs. You shouldn't set this below
  ## interval. Maximum flush_interval will be flush_interval + flush_jitter
  flush_interval = "{{ FLUSH_INTERVAL | default("10s") }}"
  ## Jitter the flush interval by a random amount. This is primarily to avoid
  ## large write spikes for users running a large number of telegraf instances.
  ## ie, a jitter of 5s and interval 10s means flushes will happen every 10-15s
  flush_jitter = "{{ FLUSH_JITTER | default("3s") }}"

  ## Run telegraf in debug mode
  debug = false
  ## Run telegraf in quiet mode
  quiet = false
  ## Override default hostname, if empty use os.Hostname()
  hostname = "{{ HOSTNAME }}"
  ## If set to true, do no set the "host" tag in the telegraf agent.
  omit_hostname = false
